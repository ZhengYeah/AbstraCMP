Paper: Multi-path Back-Propagation for Neural Network Verification

AbstraCMP improves DeepPoly to calculate a more precise over-approximate reachable set given a neural network and an input region.

Every python file contains the `if '__name__' == '__main__'` block, in which experiment setups can be found.
